------ Java Selenium Automation Testing in a Maven Project using TESTNG framework-----

Tool Usage Summary:-
In this project, Java Selenium was used for automation testing, integrated with Maven to streamline the process and simplify the setup. Maven handles dependencies and includes built-in libraries and browser drivers automatically, eliminating the need for manually managing standalone files, POM files, TestNG, or data-driven configurations. This makes the setup process efficient and error-free, as Maven ensures all necessary components are included from the outset.
The use of Selenium WebDriver enables the automation of interactions with a web application. Selenium is a powerful, open-source, user-friendly tool that can be easily installed and used for browser-based automation. The project also leverages TestNG for test execution, providing a flexible and robust framework for running tests and generating reports. Additionally, the project supports data-driven testing, where test data can be supplied from external sources, allowing tests to run with different inputs. This makes it scalable and adaptable for larger test suites.
Through the Data Provider concept, tests can be executed across multiple browsers simultaneously, ensuring broader compatibility and coverage. The framework also supports database validation and API testing for comprehensive test scenarios.

Purpose and Functionality:-
The main purpose of the automation script is to log in to a specified application and verify user credentials. If the provided credentials are valid, the script will redirect the user to a designated page within the application. After successful redirection, the script will Auto-fill the fields on the page as defined in the code. Save the data to the application's associated database for further verification.
The script also ensures that these steps are repeated reliably and consistently, eliminating human error and reducing testing time, while increasing test coverage.

Using the Data Provider concept, the script can be run across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.) simultaneously, ensuring consistent functionality across different environments.

Roles and Responsibilities:-

Design and implement the Selenium automation scripts using Java and TestNG.
Define test cases for login, form submission, and database validation.
Ensure proper integration with Maven for dependency management and setup.
Maintain and update test scripts as per application changes.
later Oversee the creation and execution of test plans and test cases.
Ensure proper test coverage and verify that all functional scenarios are tested.
Monitor automation results and resolve any issues with failed tests.
Coordinate with the development team to identify potential improvements in the test automation suite.

Impact of Automation:-

>>Increased Efficiency: By automating repetitive test cases, testing cycles are reduced, enabling faster releases and more time 
                      for exploratory testing.
>>Improved Accuracy: Automation eliminates human error, ensuring consistent execution of tests every time.
>>Scalability: Automated scripts can be reused for different browsers and environments, making the testing process scalable across 
              multiple platforms and configurations.
>>Faster Feedback: Automated testing provides immediate feedback to developers, helping identify and fix issues early in the 
                 development process.
>>Cost-Effective: Although initial setup requires time, automation ultimately reduces the overall cost of testing by decreasing 
                the need for manual intervention and minimizing the risk of defects in production.

Code Description:-
The Java Selenium framework, integrated with Maven and TestNG, is designed to automate the testing of web applications in the following manner:
Login Process:
The script navigates to the login page of the specified application.
It inputs the user credentials (username and password) into the respective fields.
After form submission, it checks whether the credentials are valid and if the user is redirected to the correct page.
After successful login, the script locates and fills out specific form fields on the next page (such as entering user details, clicking on submit button verifing all buttons in view screen

TestNG Integration:--
TestNG is used for test execution and reporting, allowing the script to be organized into test suites. TestNG also helps with generating detailed reports on test execution, which helps track test results and potential issues.

What Can Be Achieved Using Selenium???

Selenium, integrated with Java, can achieve the following:
  >>Web Automation: Automating user interactions with web applications (form filling, button clicks, link navigation, etc.).
  >>Cross-Browser Testing: Testing web applications across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior.
  >>Parallel Test Execution: Running tests simultaneously across multiple browsers or environments, speeding up the testing          process.
  >>Data-Driven Testing: Running the same tests with different data sets, ensuring broad coverage of scenarios.
  >>Integration with CI/CD: Selenium scripts can be integrated into Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)             pipelines for automated testing on each build.
  >>API Testing: Automating backend API tests in addition to the front-end web application testing.
  >>Database Validation: Verifying that data entered into the application is correctly stored and retrieved from the database.
    Seleniumâ€™s flexibility, combined with Java and Maven, allows for a highly scalable, efficient, and robust test automation        solution that can be adapted to various types of web applications and testing environments.
